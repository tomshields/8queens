An 8 Queens puzzle game for the original Palm Pilot

8 Queens is freeware, and the source is available. For the latest

8 Queens is a classic game/puzzle for the Palm Computing connected
organizer. You simply try to place 8 queens on a standard chessboard
so that no queen can attack any other.  This means that no two queens
can share the same horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line.  Click once
to place a queen, again to erase it. Try to solve the puzzle, then
click "Check" to verify your solution. If you get stuck, try putting
down a few queens and then click "Find" to have the Palm complete the
solution for you.  If some queens blink at you, that means they can
attack each other, so you'll have to move them around.  For more fun,
rotate or flip the board by clicking the arrows on the right.
